	<h4>About myself</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>I'm a grad student in the joint BS/MS program at UCSD, specializing in database. I love many areas of CS, but I'm especially interested in working with databases, developing websites, software products, and mobile apps. I still have A LOT more to learn, but I will work hard to pursue my passion.</p>
	<p>When I have free time, I like to hang out with friends, dance, play the piano, watch Pretty Little Liars, eat lots of food and sleep :).
